<h1 color="purple">AIMASHO:</h1>
<p1>Aimasho is an online dating and geosocial networking application. In Aimasho, users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photos, a short bio, and a list of their interests. Aimasho uses a "double opt-in" system where both users must like each other before they can exchange messages. </p1>
